# Keycloak

- `realm/alanfelez-realm.json` is the **production-safe** realm: clients, roles, security policies, and **no users**.
  `${VAR:default}` placeholders are resolved from the Keycloak container's environment at import time.
- `local/alanfelez-users-0.json` contains **local-only** test users. Docker Compose mounts it. It's never used in staging or production.

| Local user | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `local-admin` | `local-admin-pass` | admin |
| `local-editor` | `local-editor-pass` | editor |
| `09120000001` | `local-user-pass` | (normal user) |

Keycloak admin console (local): http://localhost:8081/admin, user `admin` / `admin` (bootstrap admin, local only).

Import only happens when the realm **doesn't exist yet**. After changing the realm file locally, run `task reset` (it wipes volumes)
or edit the realm in the console and export it. In Kubernetes the realm is applied by the Keycloak Operator (`KeycloakRealmImport`).

## Sign-up
Sign-up and sign-in are the same flow: mobile number → SMS code (`PhoneOtpAuthenticator` creates the account for a new number).
Then, once, the **sign-up form** (client, 2026-10-25; `SignupForm.java`, page `login-complete-signup.ftl`,
`apps/keycloak-theme/src/login/pages/LoginCompleteSignup.tsx`): name or company (→ `firstName`), the verified phone
(read-only), password + repeat, field of activity, the terms checkbox (required); specialty metals, province, city,
address (optional). Stored as user attributes `activity`, `metals`, `province`, `city`, `address`, `termsAcceptedAt`
(slugs; labels are in the theme). Older accounts see it once with what they have (no password fields if they have one);
staff accounts never do. `lastName` is no longer asked.

**The user profile of an existing realm isn't re-imported**, so it is applied on every deploy: the image carries the
realm's profile as `/opt/keycloak/data/user-profile.json`, and the Helm PreSync job `keycloak-profile`
(`templates/keycloak-profile-job.yaml`) PUTs it to the running Keycloak **before** the new pods start (the new profile
also works with the old code). It never blocks a deploy: on a first install or an error it logs and exits 0; then run
`realm/apply-user-profile.sh` by hand. Without the profile, a new user is sent to Keycloak's own "update profile" page
asking for a last name. The job logs in with the bootstrap admin (`alanfelez-keycloak-admin`); when that admin is
disabled before launch, give the job a service account instead.

## SMS for sign-in codes
`OTP_SMS_PROVIDER` picks the `SmsSender` (it wins over the realm's stored `smsProvider`, which the one-time realm import
froze): `console` (writes codes to the log, local/staging only) or `smsir`
(`extensions/.../sms/smsir`): sms.ir "verify" with an approved template whose parameter `CODE` receives the code, so the
realm's `messageTemplate` isn't used for it. Options: `KC_SPI_SMS_SENDER__SMSIR__API_KEY` (Secret `alanfelez-sms`),
`__TEMPLATE_ID`, `__PARAMETER` (default `CODE`), `__BASE_URL` (default `https://api.sms.ir/v1`). Helm: `keycloak.otp.smsir`.
Speed: when the phone form is shown, the sender opens its connection to sms.ir in the background (`warmUp`, no key, at
most every 15 s), and the send runs off the request thread: the code page waits at most 2.5 s for it, so a quick refusal
still shows «ارسال پیامک ممکن نشد» while a slow link no longer holds the page. The SMS delivery itself (sms.ir → operator,
30–60 s reported on 2026-10-24) is on sms.ir's side.
Code lifetime: 5 minutes (`OTP_TTL_SECONDS`, Helm `keycloak.otp.ttlSeconds`; wins over the realm's stored `ttlSeconds`,
like `OTP_SMS_PROVIDER`). A new code can still be asked for after 120 s (`resendCooldownSeconds`); it replaces the old one.
Each accepted code is logged as `sms.ir accepted a code for 0912***4567 in 412 ms (messageId 88412)`: if codes arrive
late, compare that time with the phone, and give sms.ir support the messageId.
